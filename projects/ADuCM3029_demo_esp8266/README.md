General description:

The ADuCM3029_demo_esp8266 project uses the EVAL-ADXL362-ARDZ shield which has an ADXL362 3-axis MEMS accelerometer and a incorporated NHD-C12832A1Z-NSW-BBW display (128Ã—32). However, for this example the display is not used.

The EVAL-ADICUP3029 is designed for IOT (Internet of Things) applications in mind, and therefore comes with on board Wi-Fi ESP8266 module.

Also, in order to fully make use of the IOT capability, MQTT messaging protocol is used as it is extremely simple and lightweight.
