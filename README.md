[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/AnalogDevices/OpenSource/_apis/build/status/analogdevicesinc.EVAL-ADICUP3029?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/AnalogDevices/OpenSource/_build/latest?definitionId=18&branchName=master)

## Overview ##
The EVAL-ADICUP3029 is an open source prototyping platform that can be used in combination with hardware add-ons and software to achieve application level goals.  The platform is pin compatible with Arduino Uno Rev3 shields, I2C Grove connectors from Seeed Studio, and PMOD expansion modules.  The EVAL-ADICUP3029 is designed for ultra-low power applications with six analog input channels inside an ARM Cortex-M3, which has I2C, SPI, SPORT, and UART peripherals available on board.  Out of the box connectivity options include Low Energy Bluetooth(BLE) and WiFi, making the EVAL-ADICUP3029 ideal for Internet of Thing (IoT) applications where power and connectivity are paramount

## User Guide & Downloads ##
A Detailed User Guide for the EVAL-ADICUP3029, showing how to set up the hardware and use the software,tools, and applications in combination, can be found on the Analog Devices wiki site (https://wiki.analog.com/resources/eval/user-guides/eval-adicup3029).  Links on where to download the tools (CrossCore Embedded Studio) and how to install the software/tools can also be found using that link.  A step by step tutorial of the using the tools, from how to import projects, to creating debug sessions, and creating your own projects is outlined on the wiki.  

There is also another Git repository that contains examples that are found in the "Sensors Pack" (https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/sensor-sw-pack) so you can check out the pack examples using that link.
