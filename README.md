# EVAL-ADICUP3029 Read Me

## Overview ##
The EVAL-ADICUP3029 is an open source prototyping platform that can be used in combination with hardware add-ons and software to achieve application level goals.  The platform is pin compatible with Arduino Uno Rev3 shields, I2C Grove connectors from Seeed Studio, and PMOD expansion modules.  The EVAL-ADICUP3029 is designed for ultra-low power applications with six analog input channels inside an ARM Cortex-M3, which has I2C, SPI, SPORT, and UART peripherals available on board.  Out of the box connectivity options include Low Energy Bluetooth(BLE) and WiFi, making the EVAL-ADICUP3029 ideal for Internet of Thing (IoT) applications where power and connectivity are paramount

## User Guide & Downloads ##
A Detailed User Guide for the EVAL-ADICUP3029, showing how to set up the hardware and use the software,tools, and applications in combination, can be found on the Analog Devices wiki site (https://wiki.analog.com/resources/eval/user-guides/eval-adicup3029).  Links on where to download the tools (CrossCore Embedded Studio) and how to install the software/tools can also be found using that link.  A step by step tutorial of the using the tools, from how to import projects, to creating debug sessions, and creating your own projects is outlined on the wiki.
