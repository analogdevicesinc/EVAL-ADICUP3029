    @section ProductIntro Introduction

      The ADI BLE Software package contains documentation and software for using the 
      ADuCM3029 ultra low-power microcontroller with the EM9304 Bluetooth Low-Energy 
      radio. The software is divided into three layers:
        - Framework Layer: Control flow for applications with no operating system.
        - Companion Layer: Encoding and decoding of radio packets.
        - Transport Layer: Reading and writing of radio packets.

      There are also software utilities for error handling and timestamping. These 
      layers and utilities are grouped in the "Modules" tab in this documentation. 
      Each layer of the BLE software has a module and there is also a module for 
      static configuration. The utilities are grouped into modules as well.
